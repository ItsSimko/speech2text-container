Installation
============

To install and run the **speech2text-container** project with the latest changes, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites
-------------

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed on your system.

Installation Steps
------------------

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   First, clone the project repository by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ClinicianFOCUS/speech2text-container.git

Usage
=====

To deploy and run the speech transcription service using Docker Compose, follow the steps below.

1. **Build and run the services using Docker Compose**:

   The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify the setup of the speech transcription service. This file defines two services: 
   - `speech-container` for the Whisper speech transcription model.
   - `caddy` for handling reverse proxy duties.

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.
   - Ensure that the necessary ports (default: 2224) are available on your machine.

3. **Starting the Services**:

   Run the following command to build and start the containers:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose up --build

   This will:
   - Build the `speech-container` using the provided `Dockerfile` and start it with the specified `WHISPER_MODEL`, `WHISPER_PORT`, and `WHISPER_HOST`.
   - Build and run the `caddy` container as a reverse proxy.

4. **Service Configuration**:

   The following environment variables can be customized to control the behavior of the `speech-container` service:

   - `WHISPER_MODEL`: The Whisper model to use (default: `medium`).
   - `WHISPER_PORT`: The port to expose the service (default: `2224`).
   - `WHISPER_HOST`: The host to bind the service (default: `0.0.0.0`).
   - `UVICORN_WORKERS`: Number of Uvicorn workers (default: `1`).

   **Example**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      WHISPER_MODEL=large WHISPER_PORT=8080 WHISPER_HOST=127.0.0.1 docker-compose up --build

   This will start the transcription service with the `large` Whisper model on port `8080`, accessible only from `127.0.0.1`.

5. **Stopping the Services**:

   To stop the services, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose down

   This will stop and remove the containers but will retain the built images.

API Reference
=============

Below are the available API endpoints for interacting with the Whisper Server.

.. _whisperaudio:

Whisper Audio Endpoint
----------------------

**URL**: ``/whisperaudio``

**Method**: ``POST``

**Description**:
This endpoint accepts an audio file (MP3 or WAV) and transcribes it using the Whisper model. Ensure that an API key is provided via the Authorization Bearer header.

**Parameters**:
  - **file** (required): The audio file (MP3 or WAV).
  - **api_key** (required): A valid API key for accessing the endpoint.

**Response**:
  - 200: Transcription text in a JSON format.
  - 400: Invalid file type.
  - 401: Unauthorized.
  - 413: Request entity too large.
  - 419: Rate limit exceeded.
  - 500: Server error.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/whisperaudio" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
        -F "file=@/path/to/audiofile.wav"

Response:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "text": "Transcribed text here"
   }
